          <h1>The Museums of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina</h1>
      <p>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is one of Egypt's most important contemporary landmarks and the cultural heart of the city. It contains one of the modern world's most ambitious libraries and a host of museums exploring Alexandria's history and heritage.

Its architecture is centered around a giant sun disk, which presides over the waterfront Corniche. Inside, the huge main library and its reading room can hold eight million volumes..</p>

          <h1>The Catacombs of Kom el-Shuqqafa</h1>
          <p>The Catacombs of Kom el-Shuqqafa are hewn from the rock on the southern slopes of a hill, in the Carmous district.

Thought to date from the 2nd century AD, they offer an admirable example of the characteristic Alexandrian fusion of Egyptian and Greco-Roman styles.

Discovered in 1900 (thanks to a donkey falling into them) they are laid out on several levels of sarcophagi and loculi (shelf tomb) chambers.

A spiral staircase leads down into the ground to the main rotunda.</p>

          <h1>Fort Qaitbey</h1>
          <p>Walk the long shore-front Corniche road of the Eastern Harbor heading west, and you'll finally arrive at Fort Qaitbey.

            It may be a poor substitute for what was once the site of the mighty Pharos Lighthouse – one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, which was toppled by a violent earthquake in 1303 – but this squat fort has been standing guard over Alexandria since 1480.

          <h1>Kom el-Dikka</h1>
          <p>Nobody thought much of the ancient rubble mound in central Alexandria until, in the 1960s, they decided to clear the site to make way for new housing.

As work commenced, the area known as Kom el-Dikka ("Mound of Rubble") revealed a whole swag of ancient ruins buried beneath, including a small Roman theater.

Today the area is a small archaeological park with remains from Alexandria's Greco-Roman period.

As well as the theater, there are remnants of a Ptolemaic temple, a Roman bathhouse, and various Roman-era villas.</p>

          <h1>Pompey's Pillar	</h1>
          <p>In Carmous, near the Catacombs of Kom el-Shuqqafa, is a hill littered with the remains of ancient walls, architectural fragments, and rubble on which Alexandria's only fully intact ancient monument is left standing.

Pompey's Pillar rises from the ruins of the ancient and famous Serapeion, which was once used to store the overflow of manuscripts from the Great Library of Alexandria.

This column of red Aswan granite with a Corinthian capital, actually has nothing to do with Pompey and was instead set up in AD 292 in honor of Diocletian, who supplied food for the starving population after the siege of the city.</p>

          <h1>Dive Alexandria's Underwater Ruins	</h1>
          <p>Unlike diving in the Red Sea, dives in Alexandria are not about colorful coral reefs and fish life. Instead, dive sites in the Eastern Harbor area are all about ancient underwater ruins.

For divers, Alexandria provides a unique opportunity to dive amid the toppled statues and colomns of the ancient city.

Be aware that underwater visibility is low on dives in Alexandria.

For underwater archaeologists, the waters off the coast here have provided plenty of riches in recent years.</p>

          <h1>Alexandria National Museum	</h1>
          <p>Alexandria's National Museum is a must-stop if you want to get to grips with the vast history of this famed city.

Inside, the collection guides you from the Pharaonic era, to the Hellenistic heyday, when Alexandria and Egypt were governed by the Ptolemy dynasty begun by Alexander the Great , and up to the Byzantine and Islamic periods (on the 1st floor).

The ground floor's exhibits of statuary and artifacts from the underwater archaeological explorations of the sunken port city of Heracleion-Thonis in Aboukir Bay, are the museum's major highlight..</p>

          <h1>Ras el-Tin Palace	</h1>
          <p>Sumptuous Ras el-Tin Palace was once a summer escape for Egypt's sultans when the desert heat of Cairo got too much to bear.

It's also the famed location where King Farouk – Egypt's last king – officially abdicated in 1952 before sailing out of Alexandria's harbor and into exile in Italy.

Today, the palace is used by the Egyptian navy, which means its glorious interiors are out of bounds to casual visitors, but the monumental white facade, best viewed from the harbor waters, is a must-see.

          <h1>Abu Abbas al-Mursi Mosque	</h1>
          <p>One of Alexandria's major landmarks, the Abu Abbas al-Mursi Mosque was built in 1796 over the tomb of the 13th-century Sufi holy man Abu Abbas al-Mursi.

Originally from Murcia (in Spain's Andalusia region), Abu Abbas became a highly esteemed religious leader in Alexandria, and his teachings are still revered in Egypt.

The mammoth cream-colored mosque that holds his name is a major pilgrimage site.

For non-religious visitors, the mosque's exquisite facade of swirling Islamic calligraphy designs and motifs is the major draw-card.</p>

          <h1>Visit Aboukir	</h1>
          <p>Presiding over a promontory, defended on all sides by old forts, the little fishing village of Aboukir, about 24 kilometers northeast of Alexandria, has an illustrious history that defies its small size.

This is where, on August 1st, 1798, the Battle of the Nile was fought in which Nelson inflicted an annihilating defeat on the French fleet.

Here, too, in 1799, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Turkish force; and here also, in 1801, Sir Ralph Abercromby defeated the remnants of the French army and compelled them to evacuate Egypt.</p>

          <h1> Stroll the Corniche</h1>
          <p>Downtown Alexandria's wide, waterfront Corniche Road is as much a symbol of the city as any of its monuments.

Strolling the Corniche, particularly the section between the main shorefront square of Midan Saad Zaghloul to Fort Qaitbey on the Eastern Harbor's western tip, gives you a real feel for the era of cosmopolitan elegance and decadence that marked this city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Much of the architecture from this era still stands along the Corniche, though these days, much of it is heavily dilapidated and falling into disrepair.</p>

          <h1>Cavafy Museum</h1>
          <p>One of Alexandria's most famous sons, Constantine Cavafy (1863-1933), was a Greek Alexandrian poet who found fame and recognition for his writing after his death.

His apartment on what is now Sharm el-Sheikh Street is a tribute to his life and a major attraction for anyone on an Alexandrian literary pilgrimage.

Cavafy spent his working life as a journalist and civil servant, little recognized for his poetry outside of a small group of Alexandrian-based writers (including English novelist E.M. Forster, who was a champion of Cavafy's work).</p>
